### Final Diagnosis:

* **Diabetic Cardiomyopathy**: The patient's recent diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the cardiologist's report suggesting diabetic cardiomyopathy as a possible cause of symptoms, along with the psychologist's report indicating unintentional weight loss and fatigue, which can be indicative of decreased cardiac performance.
* **Anxiety and Depression**: The psychologist's report highlighting the patient's potential anxiety and depressive symptoms due to the recent diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and required lifestyle changes, which can exacerbate the patient's physical health issues, including cardiac and respiratory problems.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: The pulmonologist's report indicating COPD as a possible respiratory issue given the patient's smoking history, which can also contribute to cardiac issues and worsen the patient's overall health, particularly in the context of their newly diagnosed diabetes.
