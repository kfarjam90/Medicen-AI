* **Diabetic Cardiomyopathy**: The patient's recent diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and the cardiologist's report suggesting diabetic cardiomyopathy as a possible cause of symptoms, along with the psychologist's report indicating unintentional weight loss and fatigue, which could be related to decreased cardiac performance.
* **Anxiety and Depression**: The psychologist's report highlights the patient's potential anxiety and depressive symptoms due to the recent diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and required lifestyle changes, which could be exacerbated by the patient's smoking habit and poor dietary habits, as well as the cardiologist's and pulmonologist's reports indicating potential underlying health issues that could contribute to the patient's mental health.
* **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**: The pulmonologist's report suggests COPD as a possible respiratory issue given the patient's smoking history, and the cardiologist's report indicating potential cardiac issues that could be related to or worsened by COPD, such as decreased cardiac performance and potential cardiac conduction abnormalities.
